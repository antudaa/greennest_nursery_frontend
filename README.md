## üîß Configuration

### Vite Configuration

Vite is used for development and build processes. The default configuration is set up in `vite.config.ts`. For more details, refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/).

### ESLint Configuration

To ensure code quality and consistency, ESLint is configured with TypeScript support. To expand and customize the ESLint configuration, follow these steps:

1. Configure the top-level `parserOptions` in `.eslintrc.js`:
    ```js
    export default {
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: 'latest',
        sourceType: 'module',
        project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
      },
      // other rules...
    }
    ```

2. Update ESLint rules:
    - Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` with `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`.
    - Optionally, add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`.

3. Install `eslint-plugin-react` and add the following to the `extends` list:
    ```json
    "extends": [
      "plugin:react/recommended",
      "plugin:react/jsx-runtime"
    ]
    ```

## üåê Deployment

To deploy the application, use Vercel. Ensure that the `vercel.json` file is correctly configured for your deployment. For more details, refer to the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).
